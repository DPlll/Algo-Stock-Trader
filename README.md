# Algo-Stock-Trader
Honors by Contract Term Project for Advance Software Applications for Economics. Use alpha advantage API and pandas to collect, organize, and analyze stock data. Then create a stock trading strategy based off this data collected.

## Project Breakdown
The project is divided into three parts, each worth 10 points:

### Data Collection:

Gather data on a stock of your choice from the 'Alphavantage API'.
Collect at least 1,000 data points (daily or intraday) and save them in a 'CSV file' to upload.
### Data Analysis:

Develop a trading strategy using the collected data.
Write a short paper (1-3 pages) in LaTeX, describing:
The stock you selected.
When to buy and sell based on your strategy.
Results of backtesting your strategy (e.g., returns on a $1 investment).
A graph showing your strategy's return over time.
Submit as a PDF.
### Programming:

Provide the Python code used to perform the analysis in Part 2.
Ensure it matches your data and analysis findings, so others can reproduce your results.
